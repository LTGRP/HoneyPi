HoneyPi
=======

This is a bash script to install/run Honeypot projects on a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian OS).

This has only been slightly tested and can be used as a guide for installing some of these projects on your own.

How to Run
======
You can either run git clone this repository or use wget:

cd ~

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binkybear/HoneyPi/master/honeypotpi.sh --no-check-certificate

sudo chmod +x honeypotpi.sh

./honeypotpi.sh
